            <p>The underrepresentation of women in the tech industry limits diversity and hampers progress, impacting both the industry and society at large.
                Population Affected:
                Women, specifically those interested in pursuing careers in the tech industry.<br/>
                Impact:
                The underrepresentation of women in the tech industry has significant consequences. It perpetuates gender disparities, deprives the industry of diverse perspectives and talents, and hinders innovation and economic growth. The cost is not only measured in terms of missed opportunities for women but also in the broader societal impact of limited progress in achieving gender equality and inclusive technological advancements. The time and resources invested in addressing this problem are essential for creating a more equitable and prosperous future.<br/>
                Importance:
                Addressing the underrepresentation of women in tech matters because it promotes gender equality, fosters innovation, and maximizes the potential of the tech industry. By increasing the participation and representation of women, the industry can tap into a larger talent pool, leading to more diverse and inclusive products, services, and technologies. It also encourages young girls and women to pursue STEM education and careers, challenging gender stereotypes and empowering them with equal opportunities.
                Desired Outcome:
                In a solved state, the tech industry would reflect gender equality, with women proportionally represented in all roles and levels. This would lead to a more inclusive and innovative industry, where diverse perspectives contribute to groundbreaking advancements. Women would have equal access to opportunities, fair compensation, and leadership positions. The gap between the present reality, where women are underrepresented and face barriers, and the desired outcome of a fully inclusive and equitable tech industry would be evident.
